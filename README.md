Hey,

Iâ€™m @DeonJordaan.

I am a self-taught software developer who recently transitioned from manufaturing.

Initially I completed foundational courses in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. I have subsequently done some work in PHP and SQL and am currently working as a junior software engineer in Angular and C#/.NET.

You can see more at www.deon.dev or reach me at hello@deon.dev.

Thank you!

Deon
