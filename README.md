Hey, I’m @DeonJordaan

I am transitioning into front-end development and interested in learning more about programming and computer science.

After completing some courses on HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I’m currently learning React and TypeScript. From here I will likely be heading towards React Native and Node.js. At least, that is the plan for now.

I’m looking for ways to contribute to the community or a cause of some sort. If you need some help on a project, please do get in touch. Disclaimer: My skills and knowledge are limited, but I am eager to learn!

Reach me at deon.jordaan76@gmail.com or @deonjordaan on twitter

Thank you!

Deon
