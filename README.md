Hey, I’m @DeonJordaan

I am transitioning into front-end development and interested in learning more about programming and computer science.

After completing some courses on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, I’m currently diving into TypeScript and also exploring more about Algorithms & Data Structures. From here I'll be heading towards React Native and Node.js while I'm also keen to deepen my knowledge of OOP. At least, that is the plan for now.

Currently I'm looking for an internship position. I’m open to contributing to the community or a cause of some sort. If you need some help on a project, please do get in touch. My skills and knowledge are limited, but I am eager to learn!

You can see some of my projects at www.deon.dev or reach me at hello@deon.dev.

Thank you!

Deon
